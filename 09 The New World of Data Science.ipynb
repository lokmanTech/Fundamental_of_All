    "In this notes, Im going though on the entire toolbox you need to become a data scientist, following might impress the interviewers by showing an understanding of the data science field, Understand the mathematics behind machine learning. I will explore on the performing linear and logistic regressions Python. Able to create machine learning algorithm in python, using NumbPy, statModels and scikit-learn. Plus, use state of the art Deep Learning framework suh as Googles's Tensorflow Develop a business intuition while and solving the tasks with big data. Improve Machine Learning algorithm by studying under fitting m over fitting training validation, n-fold cross validation, testing, and how hyper parameters could improve performance. Next, filling up the resume with in demand data science skills: Statistical analysis, python programming with numPy, pandas, matPlotLib and seaBorn advanced statistical analysis, tableau machine learning with stats models and scikit-learn deep learning with tensor flow. Learn also how to pre-process data, start coding in python and learn how to use it for statistical analysis, carry out cluster and factor analysis applying the skills to real-life business case. unfold the power of deep neural networks. Warm up your fingers as you will be eager to apply everything you have learned here to more and more real-life situations.\n",

    "Data Scientist is one of the best suited professional to thrive this century. It is digital, programming-oriented and analytical. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the demand for data scientists has been surging in the job marketplace. However, supply has been very limited. It is difficult to acquire the skills necessary to be hired as a data scientist. And how can you do that? Universities have been slow at creating specialized data science programs. Not to mention that the ones that exist are very expensive and time consuming.\n",
